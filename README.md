# Automated-Real-time-security-system


Security is a major concern even after rapid development in electronic surveillance 
and emergency response systems. A major part of the concern comes from the owner(s) being kept informed about the security status in realtime. Another problem 
which causes delay in law enforcement after a breach occurs is identification of the 
intruder.
The proposed system aims to solve these problems by providing realtime alerts to the 
owner using the internet, and to solve the identification problem through the use of 
computer vision to build up and log a comprehensive face database based on access 
and breaches into the property
